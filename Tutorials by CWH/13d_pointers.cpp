/*
Pointer to Pointer
Pointer to Pointer is a simple concept, in which we store the address of one pointer to another pointer. This is also known as multiple indirections owing to the operatorâ€™s name.  Here, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the address where the actual variable has its value stored. 

 

An example to demonstrate how we define a pointer to a pointer.

    int **c = &b;
    cout << "Value of variable a is " << a << endl;
    cout << "Address of variable a is " << b << endl;
    cout << "Address of pointer b is " << c << endl;
    cout << "Value of a is " << **c << endl;
    cout << "Value in b i.e. address of a is " << *c << endl;
