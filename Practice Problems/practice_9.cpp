/*
A student signed up for n workshops and wants to attend the maximum number of workshops where no two workshops overlap. You must do the following:

Implement  structures:

struct Workshop having the following members:

    The workshop's start time.
    The workshop's duration.
    The workshop's end time.

struct Available_Workshops having the following members:

An integer, n (the number of workshops the student signed up for).
An array of type Workshop array having size n.

Implement 2 functions:

Available_Workshops* initialize (int start_time[], int duration[], int n)
Creates an Available_Workshops object and initializes its elements using the elements in the start_time[] and duration[] parameters (both are of size ). Here, start_time[i] and duration[i] are the respective start time and duration for the ith workshop. This function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.

int CalculateMaxWorkshops(Available_Workshops* ptr)
Returns the maximum number of workshops the student can attendâ€”without overlap. The next workshop cannot be attended until the previous workshop ends.

Note: An array of unknown size () should be declared as follows:

DataType* arrayName = new DataType[n];
Input Format

Input from stdin is handled by the locked code in the editor; you simply need to write your functions to meet the specifications of the problem statement above.

Constraints

1<=N<=100000
0<=start_time[i]<=1000
1<=duration[i]<=1000

Output Format

Output to stdout is handled for you.

Your initialize function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.
Your CalculateMaxWorkshops function must return maximum number of non-overlapping workshops the student can attend.

Sample Input

6
1 3 0 5 5 8
1 1 6 2 4 1
Sample Output

CalculateMaxWorkshops should return 4.

Explanation

The first line denotes n, the number of workshops.
The next line contains n space-separated integers where the ith integer is the ith workshop's start time.
The next line contains n space-separated integers where the ith integer is the ith workshop's duration.

The student can attend the workshops 0,1,3, and 5 without overlap, so CalculateMaxWorkshops returns 4 to main (which then prints 4 to stdout).
